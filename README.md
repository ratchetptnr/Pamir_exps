# PamirAI Device Testing & Experimentation

This repository serves as a playground for testing and experimenting with the PamirAI device - a pocket-sized Linux server that runs Claude Code 24/7.

## Purpose

As a product designer on the PamirAI team, this space is used to:
- Test device capabilities and workflows
- Document user experience friction points
- Experiment with features and use cases
- Surface design and usability improvements

## Device Overview

The PamirAI device includes:
- 8GB RAM + 32GB eMMC storage
- 64-bit ARM processor (2.4 GHz)
- Hardware interfaces: GPIO, I²C, SPI, UART, PWM
- Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity
- Built-in microphone, speaker, E-ink display, and LEDs
- Remote access via QR code and web tunneling
- Persistent Claude Code integration

## Friction Logging

**All friction points, issues, and usability concerns should be documented in [`friction-log.md`](./friction-log.md).**

When encountering issues during testing, note:
- What you were trying to do
- What happened (expected vs actual behavior)
- Severity and impact
- Suggested improvements

## Getting Started

Use this repository to:
1. Run experiments with the device
2. Test remote access and connectivity
3. Try hardware interfacing projects
4. Document findings in the friction log
5. Prototype solutions and workflows

**Note to Claude Code:** When working in this repository, please help document any friction points or issues encountered in the friction log file. Be detailed and constructive in your observations.
